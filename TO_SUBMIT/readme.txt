[HOW TO COMPILE] 

• Since most of us had problems with DevC++, we decided
  to use a c++ compiler instead and ran the program via command line. 
• We have g++ installed in our device. 
• Go to the working directory by using "cd" command in cmd.
• Once there, the code below is used to compile this code: 

" g++ CE33-Project-1-Castillo-Montesclaros-Qiuwa.cpp -o test.exe "


[HOW TO RUN]
• test.exe file_name.txt
